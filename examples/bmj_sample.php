            <p>In 1999 Shah<a href="#B1">1</a> and others said that the Royal College of General Practitioners should advocate longer consultations in general practice
               as a matter of policy. The college set up a working group chaired by A P Hungin, and a systematic review of literature on
               consultation length in general practice was commissioned. The working group agreed that the available evidence would be hard
               to interpret without discussion of the changing context within which consultations now take place. For many years general
               practitioners and those who have surveyed patients' opinions in the United Kingdom have complained about short consultation
               time, despite a steady increase in actual mean length. Recently Mechanic pointed out that this is also true in the United
               States.<a href="#B2">2</a> Is there any justification for a further increase in mean time allocated per consultation in general practice?
            </p>
            <p>We report on the outcome of extensive debate among a group of general practitioners with an interest in the process of care,
               with reference to the interim findings of the commissioned systematic review and our personal databases. The review identified
               14 relevant papers.

               <h2 id="s2">Longer consultations: benefits for patients</h2>
               <p>The systematic review consistently showed that doctors with longer consultation times prescribe less and offer more advice
                  on lifestyle and other health promoting activities. Longer consultations have been significantly associated with better recognition
                  and handling of psychosocial problems<a href="#B3">3</a> and with better patient enablement.<a href="#B4">4</a> Also clinical care for some chronic illnesses is better in practices with longer booked intervals between one appointment
                  and the next.<a href="#B5">5</a> It is not clear whether time is itself the main influence or whether some doctors insist on more time.
               </p>
               <p>A national survey in 1998 reported that most (87%) patients were satisfied with the length of their most recent consultation.<a href="#B6">6</a> Satisfaction with any service will be high if expectations are met or exceeded. But expectations are modified by previous
                  experience.<a href="#B7">7</a> The result is that primary care patients are likely to be satisfied with what they are used to unless the context modifies
                  the effects of their own experience.

               <h2 id="s3">Context of modern consultations</h2>
               <p>Shorter consultations were more appropriate when the population was younger, when even a brief absence from employment due
                  to sickness required a doctor's note, and when many simple remedies were available only on prescription. Recently at least
                  five important influences have increased the content and hence the potential length of the consultation.

            </section>
            <section id="s4">
               <h2 id="s4">Participatory consultation style</h2>
               <p>The most effective consultations are those in which doctors most directly acknowledge and perhaps respond to patients' problems
                  and concerns. In addition, for patients to be committed to taking advantage of medical advice they must agree with both the
                  goals and methods proposed. A landmark publication in the United Kingdom was <em>Meetings Between Experts</em>, which argued that while doctors are the experts about medical problems in general patients are the experts on how they themselves
                  experience these problems.<a href="#B8">8</a> New emphasis on teaching consulting skills in general practice advocated specific attention to the patient's agenda, beliefs,
                  understanding, and agreement. Currently the General Medical Council, aware that communication difficulties underlie many complaints
                  about doctors, has further emphasised the importance of involving patients in consultations in its revised guidance to medical
                  schools.<a href="#B9">9</a> More patient involvement should give a better outcome, but this participatory style usually lengthens consultations.
               </p>
            </section>
            <section id="s5">
               <h2 id="s5">Extended professional agenda</h2>
               <p>The traditional consultation in general practice was brief.<a href="#B2">2</a> The patient presented symptoms and the doctor prescribed treatment. In 1957 Balint gave new insights into the meaning of
                  symptoms.<a href="#B10">10</a> By 1979 an enhanced model of consultation was presented, in which the doctors dealt with ongoing as well as presenting problems
                  and added health promotion and education about future appropriate use of services.<a href="#B11">11</a> Now, with an ageing population and more community care of chronic illness, there are more issues to be considered at each
                  consultation. Ideas of what constitutes good general practice are more complex.<a href="#B12">12</a> Good practice now includes both extended care of chronic medical problems—for example, coronary heart disease<a href="#B13">13</a>—and a public health role. At first this model was restricted to those who lead change (“early adopters”) and enthusiasts<a href="#B14">14</a> but now it is embedded in professional and managerial expectations of good practice.
               </p>
               <p>Adequate time is essential. It may be difficult for an elderly patient with several active problems to undress, be examined,
                  and get adequate professional consideration in under 15 minutes. Here the doctor is faced with the choice of curtailing the
                  consultation or of reducing the time available for the next patient. Having to cope with these situations often contributes
                  to professional dissatisfaction.<a href="#B15">15</a> This combination of more care, more options, and more genuine discussion of those options with informed patient choice inevitably
                  leads to pressure on time.
               </p>
            </section>
            <section id="s6">
               <h2 id="s6">Access problems</h2>
               <p>In a service free at the point of access, rising demand will tend to increase rationing by delay. But attempts to improve
                  access by offering more consultations at short notice squeeze consultation times.
               </p>
               <p>While appointment systems can and should reduce queuing time for consultations, they have long tended to be used as a brake
                  on total demand.<a href="#B16">16</a> This may seriously erode patients' confidence in being able to see their doctor or nurse when they need to. Patients are
                  offered appointments further ahead but may keep these even if their symptoms have remitted “just in case.” Availability of
                  consultations is thus blocked. Receptionists are then inappropriately blamed for the inadequate access to doctors.
               </p>
               <p>In response to perception of delay, the government has set targets in the NHS plan of “guaranteed access to a primary care
                  professional within 24 hours and to a primary care doctor within 48 hours.” Implementation is currently being negotiated.
               </p>
               <p>Virtually all patients think that they would not consult unless it was absolutely necessary. They do not think they are wasting
                  NHS time and do not like being made to feel so. But underlying general practitioners' willingness to make patients wait several
                  days is their perception that few of the problems are urgent. Patients and general practitioners evidently do not agree about
                  the urgency of so called minor problems. To some extent general practice in the United Kingdom may have scored an “own goal”
                  by setting up perceived access barriers (appointment systems and out of hours cooperatives) in the attempt to increase professional
                  standards and control demand in a service that is free at the point of access.
               </p>
               <p>A further government initiative has been to bypass general practice with new services—notably, walk-in centres (primary care
                  clinics in which no appointment is needed) and NHS Direct (a professional telephone helpline giving advice on simple remedies
                  and access to services). Introduced widely and rapidly, these services each potentially provide significant features of primary
                  care—namely, quick access to skilled health advice and first line treatment.
               </p>

            <section id="s7">
               <h2 id="s7">Loss of interpersonal continuity</h2>
               <p>If a patient has to consult several different professionals, particularly over a short period of time, there is inevitable
                  duplication of stories, risk of naive diagnoses, potential for conflicting advice, and perhaps loss of trust. Trust is essential
                  if patients are to accept the “wait and see” management policy which is, or should be, an important part of the management
                  of self limiting conditions, which are often on the boundary between illness and non-illness.<a href="#B17">17</a> Such duplication again increases pressure for more extra (unscheduled) consultations resulting in late running and professional
                  frustration.<a href="#B18">18</a>
                  
               </p>
               <p>Mechanic described how loss of longitudinal (and perhaps personal and relational<a href="#B19">19</a>) continuity influences the perception and use of time through an inability to build on previous consultations.<a href="#B2">2</a> Knowing the doctor well, particularly in smaller practices, is associated with enhanced patient enablement in shorter time.<a href="#B4">4</a> Though Mechanic pointed out that three quarters of UK patients have been registered with their general practitioner five
                  years or more, this may be misleading. Practices are growing, with larger teams and more registered patients. Being registered
                  with a doctor in a larger practice is usually no guarantee that the patient will be able to see the same doctor or the doctor
                  of his or her choice, who may be different. Thus the system does not encourage adequate personal continuity. This adds to
                  pressure on time and reduces both patient and professional satisfaction.

               <h2 id="s8">Health service reforms</h2>
               <p>Finally, for the past 15 years the NHS has experienced unprecedented change with a succession of major administrative reforms.
                  Recent reforms have focused on an NHS led by primary care, including the aim of shifting care from the secondary specialist
                  sector to primary care. One consequence is increased demand for primary care of patients with more serious and less stable
                  problems. With the limited piloting of reforms we do not know whether such major redirection can be achieved without greatly
                  altering the delicate balance between expectations (of both patients and staff) and what is delivered.
               </p>
            </section>
            <section id="s9">
               <h2 id="s9">The future</h2>
               <p>We think that the way ahead must embrace both longer mean consultation times and more flexibility. More time is needed for
                  high quality consultations with patients with major and complex problems of all kinds. But patients also need access to simpler
                  services and advice. This should be more appropriate (and cost less) when it is given by professionals who know the patient
                  and his or her medical history and social circumstances. For doctors, the higher quality associated with longer consultations
                  may lead to greater professional satisfaction and, if these longer consultations are combined with more realistic scheduling,
                  to reduced levels of stress.<a href="#B20">20</a> They will also find it easier to develop further the care of chronic disease.
               </p>
               <p>The challenge posed to general practice by walk-in centres and NHS Direct is considerable, and the diversion of funding from
                  primary care is large. The risk of waste and duplication increases as more layers of complexity are added to a primary care
                  service that started out as something familiar, simple, and local and which is still envied in other developed countries.<a href="#B21">21</a> Access needs to be simple, and the advantages of personal knowledge and trust in minimising duplication and overmedicalisation
                  need to be exploited.
               </p>
               <p>We must ensure better communication and access so that patients can more easily deal with minor issues and queries with someone
                  they know and trust and avoid the formality and inconvenience of a full face to face consultation. Too often this has to be
                  with a different professional, unfamiliar with the nuances of the case. There should be far more managerial emphasis on helping
                  patients to interact with their chosen practitioner<a href="#B22">22</a>; such a programme has been described.<a href="#B23">23</a> Modern information systems make it much easier to record which doctor(s) a patient prefers to see and to monitor how often
                  this is achieved. The telephone is hardly modern but is underused. Email avoids the problems inherent in arranging simultaneous
                  availability necessary for telephone consultations but at the cost of reducing the communication of emotions. There is a place
                  for both.<a href="#B2">2</a> Access without prior appointment is a valued feature of primary care, and we need to know more about the right balance between
                  planned and ad hoc consulting.
